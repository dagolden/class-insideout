NAME
    Class::InsideOut - placeholder for future implementation

SYNOPSIS
     use Class::InsideOut;

DESCRIPTION
    This is a placeholder for a coming implementation of a streamlined,
    simple toolkit for building inside-out objects. Unlike most other kits
    out there, this module will aim towards minimalism.

    In the meantime, I recommend Object::InsideOut as the most robust
    current alternative.
