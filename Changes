Revision history for Perl module Class::InsideOut

0.08 in progress

    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: property definitions now require a
      label in addition to the property hash

    - Class::ISA results are now cached when first used; also minor
      optimization of reftype switching in STORABLE_* methods (Adam Kennedy)
    
    - foreign inheritance test now checks for IO::File or skips
    
    - documentation cleanup and trailing whitespace removal (Ron Savage)

0.07 Mon Jan  9 09:48:46 EST 2006
    
    - Storable support tested with references, grouped references and circular
      references; references external to the freeze are cloned
    
    - documentation cleanup

0.06 Sun Jan  8 23:07:22 EST 2006
    
    - DESTROY cleans up all Class::InsideOut properties in the @ISA tree;
      updated documentation on object destruction for clarity; fixes 
      diamond-pattern inheritance memory leaks without requiring a DEMOLISH
      method
    
    - added first-draft support of serialization with Storable for objects
      based on scalars, arrays and hashes; tested on data values only; not 
      yet tested on values with references or objects, particularly circular
      reference chains
      
    - CLONE no longer exported; all refaddr index cleanup handled globally in
      Class::InsideOut::CLONE rather than in class-specific methods

0.05 Fri Jan  6 09:07:07 EST 2006
    
    - added caveats on usage and current limitations
    
    - more documentation tweaks
