0.14 Thu Mar 16 23:07:22 EST 2006

    - Fixed test bug where thread test wouldn't properly skip for Win32 Perl
      5.6 (with ithreads enabled for pseudofork but no threads.pm)
    
    - Improved handling of "die" in set_hook and get_hook callbacks

0.13 Fri Mar 10 10:32:08 EST 2006

    - Test for Scalar::Util::weaken fallback had a bug that would fail on
      Perl versions prior to 5.6.  Fixed to be fully backwards compatible. 
    
0.12 Wed Mar  8 21:58:58 EST 2006
    
    - Added workaround for unavailable Scalar::Util::weaken; gives warning
      about not running thread-safe; added missing weaken skips to thread/fork
      test files

    - property/public/private arguments are now validated.  Property names must
      be identifiers; Property options must be given as hash references;
      Duplicate property names are not permitted. 

    - options argument checked for proper format; option values are checked
      for validity

    - register argument checked for blessed reference

    - added optional pod/pod_coverage tests (skipped by default)

0.11 Sat Jan 28 11:09:50 EST 2006

    - tweaked Build.PL; dropped Test::More dependency to 0.45 to help pass
      ActiveState automated tests (0.45 first to offer thread safety and in the
      5.008 core); fixed copy/paste error for cleanup

    - documentation cleanup; fixed links; restructured Pod for options;
      softened alpha warnings as we get closer to a stable API

0.10 Fri Jan 27 01:41:38 EST 2006

    - added "set_hook" and "get_hook" option for custom accessor/mutator
      manipulations

    - added ":all" and ":std" tags

    - cleaned up or reorganized documentation in places; revised synopsis
      to be shorter

0.09 Fri Jan 20 14:55:14 EST 2006

    - added basic accessor generation as an option for property declarations;
      added aliases "public" and "private" as shortcuts to property options

    - added per-class default options for properties

    - added support for user-written freeze and thaw hooks

    - documentation updates: typo safety requires strict (Steven Lembark);
      caching refaddr() to minimize overhead; new features documented

0.08 Wed Jan 18 10:50:13 EST 2006

    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: property definitions now require a
      label in addition to the property hash

    - Class::ISA results are now cached when first used; also minor
      optimization of reftype switching in STORABLE_* methods (Adam Kennedy)

    - foreign inheritance test now checks for IO::File or skips

    - documentation cleanup and trailing whitespace removal (Ron Savage)

0.07 Mon Jan  9 09:48:46 EST 2006

    - Storable support tested with references, grouped references and circular
      references; references external to the freeze are cloned

    - documentation cleanup

0.06 Sun Jan  8 23:07:22 EST 2006

    - DESTROY cleans up all Class::InsideOut properties in the @ISA tree;
      updated documentation on object destruction for clarity; fixes
      diamond-pattern inheritance memory leaks without requiring a DEMOLISH
      method

    - added first-draft support of serialization with Storable for objects
      based on scalars, arrays and hashes; tested on data values only; not
      yet tested on values with references or objects, particularly circular
      reference chains

    - CLONE no longer exported; all refaddr index cleanup handled globally in
      Class::InsideOut::CLONE rather than in class-specific methods

0.05 Fri Jan  6 09:07:07 EST 2006

    - added caveats on usage and current limitations
